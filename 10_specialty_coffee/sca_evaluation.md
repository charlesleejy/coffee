### How Does the SCA (Specialty Coffee Association) Evaluate and Score Coffee?

The **Specialty Coffee Association (SCA)** uses a comprehensive system to evaluate and score coffee, ensuring that only the highest quality beans are classified as **specialty coffee**. This scoring system involves a rigorous evaluation process that assesses various sensory attributes of the coffee through a standardized method called **cupping**. The SCA’s scoring system is based on a **100-point scale**, with coffees that score **80 points or higher** being considered specialty grade.

Here’s a detailed explanation of how the SCA evaluates and scores coffee:

---

### 1. **The Cupping Process**

The SCA’s evaluation begins with a process called **cupping**, which is a methodical way of tasting and assessing coffee. During cupping, a trained evaluator (such as a **Q grader**) prepares and tastes multiple samples of coffee in a controlled environment. This process helps ensure objectivity and consistency in the evaluation.

#### **Steps in the Cupping Process**:
1. **Sample Preparation**:
   - Coffee beans are roasted to a specific degree and then ground.
   - Hot water is added to the ground coffee in a small cup, allowing the grounds to steep.
   - The coffee is left to rest for a few minutes, during which time a crust of grounds forms on the surface.
   
2. **Breaking the Crust**:
   - The evaluator breaks the crust by gently stirring it with a spoon, releasing the coffee's aroma.
   - The evaluator smells the coffee to assess its **fragrance** and **aroma**.

3. **Tasting**:
   - Once the coffee cools slightly, the evaluator tastes the coffee by **slurping** it from a spoon. Slurping allows the coffee to spread across the palate and enhances the ability to detect different flavor notes.
   - The evaluator will taste the coffee multiple times to assess how its flavors evolve as the coffee cools.

### 2. **Attributes Assessed by the SCA**

The SCA scoring system focuses on evaluating 10 specific attributes of coffee, each of which contributes to the overall score. These attributes include both **positive characteristics** (like flavor, aroma, and balance) and **defects** (such as unpleasant tastes or aromas).

#### **The 10 Key Attributes Evaluated**:

1. **Fragrance/Aroma**:
   - **Fragrance** refers to the smell of the coffee grounds before brewing, while **aroma** refers to the smell of the brewed coffee.
   - Evaluators look for pleasant and distinct aromas (e.g., fruity, floral, spicy, nutty) and rate the strength and quality of the coffee’s aroma.
   
2. **Flavor**:
   - This is the overall taste of the coffee and includes both the **primary flavors** (like chocolate, fruit, or spices) and **secondary flavors** that may emerge as the coffee cools.
   - The evaluator assesses how enjoyable and complex the flavors are.

3. **Aftertaste**:
   - The aftertaste is the flavor that lingers in the mouth after swallowing the coffee.
   - A good aftertaste should be **pleasant** and **long-lasting**, while a poor aftertaste may be bitter or astringent.

4. **Acidity**:
   - Acidity gives coffee its **brightness** and **liveliness**. It is often perceived as a tangy or crisp sensation.
   - High-quality coffees have balanced acidity that enhances their flavor without being too sharp or sour.

5. **Body**:
   - The body refers to the **weight** or **mouthfeel** of the coffee—how thick, full, or thin the coffee feels on the palate.
   - Coffees with a **full body** feel rich and satisfying, while **light-bodied** coffees may feel more delicate and tea-like.

6. **Balance**:
   - Balance refers to how well all the different sensory attributes (acidity, sweetness, bitterness, body) work together in harmony.
   - A well-balanced coffee has no single element that overwhelms the others, creating a cohesive and pleasing overall flavor profile.

7. **Sweetness**:
   - Sweetness refers to the natural sugars present in the coffee beans, which add smoothness and roundness to the flavor.
   - A coffee with good sweetness will have a soft, pleasant taste, without bitterness or sourness dominating.

8. **Clean Cup**:
   - Cleanliness refers to the **clarity of flavor** in the coffee, free from any off-flavors or defects.
   - A clean cup has **pure**, well-defined flavors, with no muddiness or unpleasant notes like fermentation, mold, or mustiness.

9. **Uniformity**:
   - Uniformity evaluates the **consistency** of the coffee's flavor across multiple cups from the same batch. This ensures that every cup from a particular lot tastes the same, without noticeable variations in flavor.
   - Consistency is key to producing high-quality coffee.

10. **Overall**:
   - The overall score is a summary of the evaluator’s general impression of the coffee’s quality. It takes into account the coffee’s complexity, balance, and how well the various attributes come together.

### 3. **The 100-Point Scoring System**

The SCA scoring system is based on a **100-point scale**. Each of the 10 attributes listed above is scored on a scale of **0 to 10**, with 10 being the highest possible score. These individual scores are then added up to give the coffee an overall score.

#### **SCA Scoring Scale**:
- **90-100 Points**: **Outstanding Specialty Coffee** – Coffees with a score in this range are considered truly exceptional, with outstanding complexity, clarity, balance, and flavor.
- **85-89.99 Points**: **Excellent Specialty Coffee** – These coffees have a high level of complexity and are often highly sought after in the specialty market.
- **80-84.99 Points**: **Very Good Specialty Coffee** – Coffees that score in this range are still considered specialty grade but may not have the same complexity or clarity as higher-scoring coffees.
- **Below 80 Points**: **Non-Specialty Coffee** – Coffees that score below 80 are not considered specialty grade and may have noticeable defects or lack the complexity required to meet specialty coffee standards.

For a coffee to be classified as **specialty coffee**, it must score at least **80 points**. Coffees with higher scores are often more desirable and command higher prices in the market.

### 4. **Defects and Their Impact on the Score**

While the SCA primarily focuses on positive attributes, it also evaluates **defects** that can negatively affect the coffee's quality. Defects can be **physical** (such as damaged or moldy beans) or **sensory** (such as unpleasant flavors).

- **Primary Defects**: These are severe defects like fermentation issues, mold, or insect damage, which can cause unpleasant flavors such as mustiness, sourness, or bitterness. Primary defects significantly reduce the overall score and can disqualify coffee from being classified as specialty grade.
- **Secondary Defects**: These are less severe issues, such as minor discoloration or broken beans. While they may not completely disqualify a coffee from specialty status, they can still reduce the final score.

### 5. **The Role of Q Graders in the Evaluation Process**

The SCA relies on **certified Q graders** to perform these evaluations. Q graders are highly trained professionals who have passed a series of exams to assess their ability to identify and score coffee’s sensory attributes. Their evaluations ensure that the coffee grading process is objective, consistent, and aligned with SCA standards.

### Conclusion

The SCA’s evaluation and scoring process ensures a consistent and objective assessment of coffee quality. By focusing on attributes like flavor, aroma, acidity, balance, and body, and using a 100-point scale, the SCA helps define what qualifies as **specialty coffee**. Coffees that score **80 points or higher** are considered specialty grade, while those scoring lower are deemed non-specialty. This system helps producers, roasters, and consumers identify the highest-quality coffees and supports a market that values excellence in coffee production.
