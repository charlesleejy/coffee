### Ideal Brewing Time and Temperature for Espresso

To achieve a perfect espresso shot, it's crucial to maintain the correct brewing time and water temperature. Both of these factors directly impact the extraction process, which in turn influences the flavor, body, and balance of the espresso.

#### 1. **Brewing Time**
- **Ideal Range**: **25-30 seconds**
  - The brewing time starts when the pump is activated and ends when the desired amount of espresso is extracted (usually 25-30 mL for a single shot and 50-60 mL for a double shot).
  - A brewing time shorter than 25 seconds typically results in **under-extracted** espresso, which will taste sour, weak, or watery.
  - A brewing time longer than 30 seconds can cause **over-extraction**, leading to a bitter, harsh, or astringent flavor.

#### 2. **Water Temperature**
- **Ideal Range**: **195°F to 205°F (90°C to 96°C)**
  - The water temperature should be in the range of **195°F to 205°F (90°C to 96°C)** during the extraction process.
  - **Too Cold**: Water below 195°F (90°C) will lead to **under-extraction**, resulting in a sour, acidic, and weak espresso shot.
  - **Too Hot**: Water above 205°F (96°C) can cause **over-extraction**, producing a bitter, burnt, or overly harsh flavor.

### Key Takeaways:

- **Brewing Time**: 25-30 seconds for optimal extraction.
- **Water Temperature**: 195°F to 205°F (90°C to 96°C) to ensure a balanced flavor.

### Summary:

Maintaining the correct **brewing time** (25-30 seconds) and **water temperature** (195°F to 205°F) ensures a well-extracted espresso shot with a balanced flavor profile, full body, and rich crema. Deviating from these ranges may lead to under- or over-extraction, affecting the taste and quality of the espresso.
