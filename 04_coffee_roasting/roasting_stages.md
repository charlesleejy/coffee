### Stages of Coffee Roasting: From Green Beans to Fully Roasted

Coffee roasting transforms **green coffee beans** into the familiar aromatic and flavorful roasted beans used to brew coffee. This process involves applying heat to the beans in a controlled environment, where chemical reactions and physical changes take place. The stages of coffee roasting can be broken down into several key phases, each impacting the flavor, aroma, and overall profile of the coffee.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the roasting process, from green beans to fully roasted:

#### 1. **Green Coffee Beans**

- **Stage**: Before the roasting process begins, the beans are in their raw, unroasted state. Green beans are dense and contain moisture, with little to no aroma or flavor reminiscent of coffee.
- **Appearance**: Green to pale in color, with a slightly grassy or vegetal smell.
- **Moisture Content**: Green beans typically contain 10-12% moisture, which will be evaporated during roasting.
  
#### 2. **Drying Phase**

- **Stage**: The first phase of roasting is the drying phase, where the beans lose their initial moisture. This is a preparatory stage where the beans heat up gradually, and moisture evaporates from the inside. The drying phase typically lasts around 4-8 minutes, depending on the roasting method and desired roast level.
- **Temperature Range**: The temperature of the beans reaches approximately **160°C (320°F)** by the end of this phase.
- **Importance**: This stage is critical to prepare the beans for the subsequent chemical reactions. Even drying ensures uniformity in the roast.

#### 3. **Yellowing and Steam Release**

- **Stage**: As the moisture evaporates, the beans begin to turn yellow, and the smell of grass or hay emerges. The beans start to expand slightly, but no significant chemical changes have occurred yet.
- **Steam**: You’ll notice steam releasing from the beans as the water content evaporates.
- **Temperature Range**: Around **160°C (320°F)**.
- **Importance**: This stage is part of the gradual progression toward browning. Ensuring even heat distribution at this stage is essential for consistent roasting.

#### 4. **Browning (Maillard Reaction)**

- **Stage**: The **Maillard reaction** begins at this stage, where amino acids and reducing sugars in the beans interact, resulting in browning. This phase is crucial for developing the coffee’s flavor and aroma. The beans turn from yellow to light brown, and the grassy smell fades, giving way to a more complex aroma.
- **Flavor Development**: The Maillard reaction creates the initial layers of flavor, producing nutty, malty, and caramel-like aromas. This stage determines the foundation of the coffee's sweetness and body.
- **Temperature Range**: Beans are heated to around **160-180°C (320-356°F)**.
- **Importance**: Proper control of this stage is essential for producing balanced flavors, as the Maillard reaction sets the tone for the coffee's sweetness and overall profile.

#### 5. **First Crack**

- **Stage**: As the beans continue to heat, they reach a point where internal pressure builds up due to the evaporation of water and expansion of gases within the beans. This results in the **first crack**, a popping sound similar to popcorn. The first crack signifies the transition into the development phase of roasting, where the beans become drinkable.
- **Physical Changes**: The beans expand and double in size, their surface becomes smoother, and they turn a medium to dark brown depending on the roast level. They also become less dense.
- **Flavor Development**: After the first crack, the beans begin to develop more complex flavors, moving from sweet and caramelized to more pronounced nutty, chocolatey, or even fruity notes.
- **Temperature Range**: Around **196-204°C (385-400°F)**.
- **Importance**: The first crack is a key marker in the roasting process. At this point, the beans have entered a drinkable state, and the roast can be stopped for a light roast or continued for darker roasts.

#### 6. **Development Phase (Post First Crack)**

- **Stage**: During this phase, the roast develops the coffee’s final flavor profile. Depending on how long the roast continues after the first crack, different characteristics can emerge:
  - **Light Roast**: Stopping the roast shortly after the first crack results in light roasts with bright acidity and complex, nuanced flavors.
  - **Medium Roast**: A bit more time after the first crack produces medium roasts with balanced acidity, sweetness, and body, often highlighting caramel and chocolate notes.
  - **Dark Roast**: Allowing the roast to continue beyond the development phase leads to darker roasts, where acidity decreases and more bitterness and roasted flavors (like chocolate, smoke, and spice) emerge.
- **Temperature Range**: Typically **205-220°C (400-428°F)** for light to medium roasts.
- **Importance**: The duration of the development phase is crucial for determining the final flavor profile of the coffee. Roasters often experiment with the length of this phase to fine-tune the sweetness, acidity, and bitterness.

#### 7. **Second Crack (Dark Roast)**

- **Stage**: If the roast is extended past the first crack, the beans may reach the **second crack**, which occurs when the cell structure of the beans begins to break down. This results in a crackling sound and the release of oils onto the surface of the beans.
- **Physical Changes**: The beans become dark brown to nearly black, with a shiny, oily surface. They are less dense and have a stronger, more intense aroma.
- **Flavor Development**: At this stage, the flavors shift toward more roasted, smoky, and bitter notes. The original characteristics of the bean’s origin (such as fruity or floral notes) are muted, and the roast itself becomes the dominant flavor.
- **Temperature Range**: Around **224-230°C (435-446°F)**.
- **Importance**: The second crack signals the development of dark roast coffee. Roasters must be careful, as roasting too far beyond this point can result in burnt or overly bitter flavors.

#### 8. **Cooling**

- **Stage**: Once the desired roast level is achieved, the beans must be quickly cooled to stop the roasting process and prevent over-roasting. This is usually done using air or water to rapidly bring down the temperature.
- **Importance**: Proper cooling is essential to preserve the desired flavor profile. If the beans are not cooled quickly, they can continue to roast due to residual heat, leading to overdevelopment or bitterness.

#### 9. **Degassing and Resting**

- **Stage**: After roasting, the beans release carbon dioxide, a process known as **degassing**. Freshly roasted coffee needs time to degas before brewing; otherwise, the CO2 can affect the extraction process.
- **Time Frame**: Beans are typically rested for 12-48 hours after roasting, depending on the roast level and the desired brewing method.
- **Importance**: Degassing allows the flavors to stabilize, improving the overall taste and aroma of the coffee. Beans that have not fully degassed may taste flat or underdeveloped.
