### Differences Between Light, Medium, and Dark Roasts: Flavor, Acidity, and Body

The degree to which coffee is roasted—**light**, **medium**, or **dark**—significantly impacts its flavor profile, acidity, and body. Each roast level highlights different characteristics of the coffee, and choosing between them can greatly influence your coffee experience.

Here’s a breakdown of the key differences:

#### 1. **Light Roast**

- **Flavor**:
  - Light roasts preserve the **natural flavors** of the coffee beans, allowing the characteristics of the bean’s origin (terroir), variety, and processing method to shine through.
  - **Flavor Notes**: Light roasts often feature fruity, floral, citrusy, or herbal notes, depending on the origin of the beans. You may also detect hints of berries, jasmine, stone fruit, or even tea-like qualities. These nuanced flavors are especially prevalent in high-quality, single-origin coffees.
  - **Less Roast Flavor**: Since light roasts are roasted for a shorter time and at lower temperatures, there’s minimal influence from the roasting process itself, resulting in fewer caramelized, toasted, or smoky flavors.

- **Acidity**:
  - Light roasts are known for their **high acidity**, which gives the coffee a bright, lively, and often crisp taste. This acidity can be citrusy or tangy, adding a refreshing quality to the cup. Acidity is one of the defining traits of light roasts and is typically more pronounced in beans from regions like Africa (e.g., Ethiopian and Kenyan coffees).

- **Body**:
  - The body of a light roast is typically **light and delicate**, with a tea-like or smooth mouthfeel. Light roasts generally have a thinner texture, as the shorter roasting time preserves more of the bean’s moisture and volatile compounds.
  - **Mouthfeel**: Light roasts often feel cleaner and lighter on the palate, allowing the complexity of flavors and acidity to take center stage.

- **Roasting Temperature**:
  - Light roasts are roasted to an internal temperature of around **196-204°C (385-400°F)**, typically ending shortly after the **first crack**.

#### 2. **Medium Roast**

- **Flavor**:
  - Medium roasts strike a balance between the **natural flavors** of the bean and the development of **roasted flavors**. While some of the origin characteristics (like fruity or floral notes) are still present, medium roasts also introduce caramelized, nutty, or chocolatey flavors due to increased Maillard reaction and sugar caramelization.
  - **Flavor Notes**: You may find flavors like caramel, toasted nuts, milk chocolate, and subtle fruitiness in medium roasts. This roast level often produces a well-rounded cup with more sweetness than a light roast but without the heavy roasted flavors of a dark roast.

- **Acidity**:
  - Medium roasts typically have **moderate acidity**, providing a balanced cup. The brightness of the acidity is still present but is less pronounced than in light roasts. This balanced acidity adds to the overall sweetness and richness of the coffee.

- **Body**:
  - Medium roasts tend to have a **medium body**, providing a richer, fuller mouthfeel compared to light roasts. The texture is smooth and well-rounded, with a satisfying mouthfeel that isn't too thin or too heavy.
  - **Mouthfeel**: Medium roasts often feel more substantial on the palate, with a creamy or velvety texture.

- **Roasting Temperature**:
  - Medium roasts are roasted to an internal temperature of around **205-220°C (400-428°F)**, typically ending sometime after the first crack but before the **second crack**.

#### 3. **Dark Roast**

- **Flavor**:
  - Dark roasts are characterized by **strong, bold roasted flavors**, often masking the original flavors of the beans. The longer roasting time leads to increased caramelization and carbonization, resulting in flavors that are dominated by chocolate, roasted nuts, and smoky or toasted notes.
  - **Flavor Notes**: You may detect flavors like dark chocolate, caramel, roasted nuts, spice, and sometimes hints of tobacco or smoke. Dark roasts tend to have less complexity and fewer fruity or floral notes, as the roasting process overwhelms the natural characteristics of the beans.
  - **Bitterness**: Dark roasts often have a **more bitter taste** due to the higher levels of caramelization and the potential for burnt or charred flavors. This bitterness can be appealing for those who enjoy a strong, robust cup.

- **Acidity**:
  - Dark roasts have **low acidity**, as the roasting process reduces the brightness that is more prominent in lighter roasts. The cup is generally smoother, with very little tanginess or sharpness. The muted acidity makes dark roasts feel more rounded and mellow.

- **Body**:
  - Dark roasts are known for their **full body**, offering a heavy, rich, and bold mouthfeel. The beans lose more moisture during the longer roasting process, resulting in a denser texture and often a more oily surface.
  - **Mouthfeel**: Dark roasts tend to feel heavier and more robust on the palate, with a thicker, sometimes even syrupy, texture. This is particularly common in espresso blends or French roasts.

- **Roasting Temperature**:
  - Dark roasts are roasted to an internal temperature of around **224-230°C (435-446°F)**, often extending into or beyond the **second crack**. The beans become dark brown or almost black, with oils visibly rising to the surface.

### Key Takeaways:

- **Light Roasts**: Highlight the coffee’s origin and natural flavors, with **high acidity**, **light body**, and **bright, fruity, or floral** notes. Ideal for those who enjoy a crisp, complex cup that emphasizes the unique characteristics of the beans.
  
- **Medium Roasts**: Offer a **balanced** cup with **moderate acidity**, **medium body**, and a mix of **natural and roasted flavors**. Caramel, chocolate, and subtle fruitiness are common. These roasts provide a versatile option with a smooth and well-rounded profile.

- **Dark Roasts**: Feature **bold, robust flavors**, with **low acidity**, **full body**, and a focus on **roasted, smoky, and bitter** notes like dark chocolate and toast. These roasts are great for those who prefer a strong, intense coffee with less emphasis on the beans' original characteristics.

### Conclusion

The roast level of coffee—whether light, medium, or dark—has a profound impact on its **flavor, acidity, and body**. **Light roasts** are bright and fruity, with high acidity and a lighter body, allowing the bean’s origin to shine through. **Medium roasts** offer a balance of sweetness, acidity, and body, with both natural and roasted flavors present. **Dark roasts** are rich, bold, and low in acidity, with a full body and flavors dominated by caramelization and roasting, often at the expense of the bean’s original nuances. Choosing the right roast level depends on your flavor preferences and the type of coffee experience you're looking for.
