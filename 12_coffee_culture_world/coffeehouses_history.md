Philosophers, poets, artists, and scholars frequently gathered in coffeehouses to engage in discourse on current events, culture, and philosophy.

- **Religious Significance**: In some areas, particularly in Islamic societies, coffee was seen as a stimulant that could help worshippers stay awake for night prayers, further linking coffeehouses with religious and spiritual life.

#### Cultural Impact:
- Qahveh khanehs quickly spread throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and Persia, becoming essential parts of social life.
