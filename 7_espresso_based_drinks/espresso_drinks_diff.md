### Differences Between Common Espresso-Based Drinks

Espresso is the base for a wide variety of popular coffee drinks. What sets each apart is the amount of **milk**, **foam**, **water**, or additional flavorings used in combination with the espresso shot. Here’s a breakdown of the most common espresso-based drinks and how they differ:

#### 1. **Cappuccino**
- **Ingredients**: 
  - 1 shot of espresso
  - Equal parts **steamed milk** and **milk foam**
- **Ratio**: Typically, a cappuccino is made with one-third espresso, one-third steamed milk, and one-third milk foam.
- **Texture**: Cappuccino has a thick, creamy texture due to the large amount of milk foam.
- **Flavor**: It is more balanced between coffee and milk than a latte, with a stronger espresso flavor due to less milk dilution and more foam.
- **Serving Size**: Traditionally served in a 5-6 oz cup.

#### 2. **Latte (Caffè Latte)**
- **Ingredients**:
  - 1 shot of espresso
  - **Steamed milk** (more than a cappuccino)
  - A small amount of **milk foam** (optional)
- **Ratio**: Usually one part espresso to three or more parts steamed milk.
- **Texture**: Lattes are smooth and creamy due to the large amount of steamed milk. They have less foam than cappuccinos, creating a more velvety mouthfeel.
- **Flavor**: The large amount of milk makes the espresso flavor more subdued, resulting in a milder, milkier drink compared to a cappuccino.
- **Serving Size**: Typically served in an 8-12 oz cup.

#### 3. **Macchiato (Espresso Macchiato)**
- **Ingredients**:
  - 1 shot of espresso
  - A **small amount of milk foam**
- **Ratio**: Primarily espresso with just a "mark" or "stain" of milk foam on top (macchiato means "stained" or "marked" in Italian).
- **Texture**: The texture is similar to an espresso shot but with a hint of creaminess from the small amount of foam.
- **Flavor**: The macchiato retains a strong espresso flavor with only a slight softening from the milk foam, making it more intense than a cappuccino or latte.
- **Serving Size**: Typically served in a small 2-3 oz cup.

#### 4. **Americano (Caffè Americano)**
- **Ingredients**:
  - 1 shot of espresso
  - **Hot water**
- **Ratio**: 1 part espresso to 2-3 parts hot water, depending on desired strength.
- **Texture**: The texture is closer to brewed coffee but has the deeper, richer flavor profile of espresso.
- **Flavor**: The added hot water dilutes the espresso, making it milder, similar in strength to drip coffee but with the distinctive taste of espresso.
- **Serving Size**: Usually served in an 8-12 oz cup.

#### 5. **Flat White**
- **Ingredients**:
  - 1 shot of espresso (or double shot, called a "ristretto")
  - **Steamed milk** (without foam)
- **Ratio**: Similar to a latte, but with less milk—usually a 1:2 espresso-to-milk ratio.
- **Texture**: Smoother and creamier than a cappuccino, but with a velvety texture due to the microfoam created by steaming the milk without excessive froth.
- **Flavor**: The flat white has a stronger espresso flavor compared to a latte, with a silky milk texture.
- **Serving Size**: Traditionally served in a 5-6 oz cup.

#### 6. **Caffè Mocha (Mocha Latte)**
- **Ingredients**:
  - 1 shot of espresso
  - **Steamed milk**
  - **Chocolate syrup** or powder
  - Optional **whipped cream**
- **Ratio**: Similar to a latte but with added chocolate and sometimes topped with whipped cream.
- **Texture**: Creamy and rich, with a smooth texture from the steamed milk and a dessert-like sweetness from the chocolate.
- **Flavor**: The mocha combines the bitterness of espresso with the sweetness of chocolate, making it more of a dessert coffee.
- **Serving Size**: Typically served in an 8-12 oz cup.

#### 7. **Cortado**
- **Ingredients**:
  - 1 shot of espresso
  - An equal amount of **steamed milk** (without foam)
- **Ratio**: A 1:1 ratio of espresso to milk.
- **Texture**: The cortado is smooth, but not as creamy as a latte or flat white, with little to no foam.
- **Flavor**: The equal parts milk and espresso make for a balanced drink that softens the espresso's acidity and bitterness without overpowering it with milk.
- **Serving Size**: Typically served in a 4-5 oz glass.

#### 8. **Ristretto**
- **Ingredients**:
  - 1 shot of espresso (extracted with less water)
- **Ratio**: Less water than a standard espresso shot, resulting in a more concentrated shot (typically 15-20 mL).
- **Texture**: A thicker, more syrupy texture than a regular espresso shot.
- **Flavor**: The ristretto is more intense and sweeter than espresso, as it extracts fewer bitter compounds.
- **Serving Size**: 0.5-1 oz.

#### 9. **Lungo**
- **Ingredients**:
  - 1 shot of espresso (extracted with more water)
- **Ratio**: More water than a standard espresso shot, resulting in a larger, more diluted espresso (about 60-90 mL).
- **Texture**: Lungo has a thinner texture than a regular espresso.
- **Flavor**: A lungo has a milder, less concentrated flavor compared to an espresso, but it can also taste more bitter due to the longer extraction time.
- **Serving Size**: 2-3 oz.
